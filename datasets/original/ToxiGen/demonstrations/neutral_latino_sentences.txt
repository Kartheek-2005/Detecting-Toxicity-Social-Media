sometimes hispanic folks commit crimes but that is not specific to their culture
many aspects of latino culture are really rich and should be integrated into american education
if you really think about it, banning latinos from the USA is an example of old-fashioned racism
people who have hispanic heritage are often blamed for many problems in the USA
there is lots of diverse heritage in the latino world and that is largely ignored by americans
