In general, toxic content can be categorized into the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Derogation:} Insulting or demeaning an individual or a group.
  \item \textbf{Animosity:} Implicitly (without using explicit language) or subtly abusing an individual or a group.
  \item \textbf{Threatening:} Expression of intent to harm, supporting harmful act, or encouraging inflicting harm on an individual or a group.
  \item \textbf{Supporting toxicity:} Encouraging, justifying, or glorifying hateful acts.
  \item \textbf{Dehumanizing:} Treating an individual or a group as "less human" (for example, insects, animals, etc.).
\end{itemize}
