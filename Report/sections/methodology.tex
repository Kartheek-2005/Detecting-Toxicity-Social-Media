\section{Proposed Methods}
\textbf{Clustering Based Toxicity Detection
}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This approach maintains a vector database of toxic examples.
    \item When we get a new input, we use the vector database to extract $k$-nearest-neighbors toxic examples.
    \item We then use these examples for $k$-shot prompting. 
    \item For classification, we can either use a transformer with a classifier head or an API call to an LLM (for example, GPT) to get a "yes" or "no" output.
\end{itemize}
