\section{Conclusion}

This preliminary report addresses the challenge of detecting toxic content on social media using machine learning techniques. We have explored nearest-neighbour-based methods and the use of large language models to improve classification accuracy. There are Challenges including dataset biases and the subjective nature of toxicity. 
Our efforts will focus on refining models and mitigating biases to enhance robustness across diverse contexts.
