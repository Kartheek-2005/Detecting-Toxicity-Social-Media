\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given some social media content (in the form of natural language), we need to predict whether it is toxic (i.e. a binary classification problem).
        \item Formally speaking, given a natural language input $x = (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n)$, we need to predict the probability that $x$ is toxic, which acts as a toxicity measure for $x$.
    \end{itemize}
